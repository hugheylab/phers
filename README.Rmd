`phers` is an R package for calculating phenotype risk scores that quantify
a person's likelihood of having a Mendelian disease given data from electronic health records. For details about the phenotype risk score model see [Bastarache et. al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590070/)

## Installation
