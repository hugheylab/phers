\usage{
mapDiseaseToPhecode(
  diseaseIDs = unique(phers::diseaseHpoMap[db_name == "OMIM"]$disease_id),
  dbName = "OMIM",
  diseaseHpoMap = phers::diseaseHpoMap,
  hpoPhecodeMap = phers::hpoPhecodeMap
)
}
\arguments{
\item{diseaseIDs}{A numeric vector of disease identifiers to be mapped}

\item{dbName}{A character string of the name of database used for mapping.
One of either 'OMIM', 'ORPHA', and 'DECIPHER'.}

\item{diseaseHpoMap}{A data.table containing the mapping between disease
entities in \code{diseaseIDs} and HPO terms. The columns are \code{db_name},
\code{disease_id}, \code{term_id}. By default uses the map included in this package.}

\item{hpoPhecodeMap}{A data.table containing the mapping between HPO terms
and phecodes. The columns are \code{term_id} and \code{phecode}. By default uses the
map included in this package.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing the mapping between diseases and phecodes.
The columns are \code{disease_id} and \code{phecode}.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of disease identifiers and returns the
clinical features mapped to them as phecodes.
