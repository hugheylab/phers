\title{Calculate the Phenotype Risk Score}
\usage{
calcPheRS(demos, phecodes, weights, diseaseIDs, dbName = "OMIM")
}
\arguments{
\item{demos}{A data.table containing demographic information for each person
in the population. The columns are \code{person_ID}, \code{sex}, \code{uniq_age},
\code{first_age}, and \code{last_age}. The age columns specify the number of
unique years with ICD codes, the age of the individual at first ICD code,
and the age of the individual at last ICD code.}

\item{phecodes}{A data.table containing phenotypes stored as phecodes
for each person. The columns are \code{person_ID} and \code{phecode}.}

\item{weights}{A data.table where each row is a phecode and the weight
corresponding to it. The columns are \code{phecode} and \code{w}.}

\item{diseaseIDs}{vector of disease IDs to calculate PheRS for.}
}
\value{
A data.table of raw and residualized phenotype risk scores
with one row per person per disease. The columns are \code{person_ID},
\code{disease_ID}, \code{phers}, \code{rphers}.
}
\description{
Calculate the phenotype risk score (PheRS)
for a group of individuals and diseases
