```{r setup}

calculate PheRS
```{r}
# map ICD codes to phecodes
phecodes = mapICDToPhecode(icdSample) 
# calculate weights 
weights = getWeights(demoSample, phecodes) 
# vector of disease IDs to calculate PheRS for
diseaseIDs = c(154700) 
# database name used for linking diseases to phenotypes
dbName = 'OMIM' 
# mape diseases to phecodes
diseasePhecodeMap = mapDiseaseToPhecode(diseaseIDs, dbName) 
# calculate PheRS
scores = getPheRS(demoSample, phecodes, weights, diseasePhecodeMap)
```

perform positive control analysis using known cases and controls
```{r}
# map ICD codes to phecodes excluding diagnostic phecodes
diseasePhecodeMapNoDx = mapDiseaseToPhecode(diseaseIDs, dbName, excludeDx = TRUE) 
# calculate PheRS
scores = getPheRS(demoSample, phecodes, weights, diseasePhecodeMapNoDx)

cases = getCases(phecodes)
runPositiveControl(scores, cases, 154700)
```


perform genotype association 
```{r}
covariates = demoSample[, .(person_id, sex)]
genoStats = genotypeAssociation(scores, genoSample, covariates)
```
