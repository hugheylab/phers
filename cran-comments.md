## R CMD check results

### Local check
`devtools::check()` result:

  0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 0 notes ✓

### Online check
`devtools::check_rhub()` result:

  

  0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 0 notes x

Notes:
  - This is the first time this package is being submitted to CRAN, and the words are names and calculation methods, so ignore this.
  - The second note only occurs on the Windows Server rhub environment, and from what I have seen about these types of notes they do not occur when building and checking on CRAN.

You can also see the results of R CMD check on Windows, Linux, and MacOS by going to the GitHub Actions run labeled `check-deploy` [here](https://github.com/hugheylab/phers/actions).
